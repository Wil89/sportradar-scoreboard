## Assumptions
1. If a game is finished it will be removed from the scoreboard (the state) and won't be displayed in summary.
If this wasn't the right approach the alternative solution will be just to update the modified game to game status finished and filter the games by status.

2. A score can't be reduced, once a team score is updated this can be reduced (NO VAR for cancelling goal :D)
